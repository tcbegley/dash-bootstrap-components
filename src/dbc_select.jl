    dbc_select(;kwargs...)

A Select component.
Create a HTML select element with Bootstrap styles. Specify options as a
list of dictionaries with keys label, value and disabled.
Keyword arguments:
- `id` (String; optional): The ID of this component, used to identify dash components
in callbacks. The ID needs to be unique across all of the
components in an app.
- `style` (Dict; optional): Defines CSS styles which will override styles previously set.
- `className` (String; optional): Often used with CSS to style elements with common properties.
- `key` (String; optional): A unique identifier for the component, used to improve
performance by React.js while rendering components
See https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html for more info
- `placeholder` (String; optional): Placeholder text to display before a selection is made.
- `value` (String | Real; optional): The value of the currently selected option.
- `options` (Array; optional): An array of options for the select
- `disabled` (Bool; optional): Set to True to disable the Select.
- `valid` (Bool; optional): Apply valid style to the Input for feedback purposes. This will cause
any FormFeedback in the enclosing FormGroup with valid=True to display.
- `invalid` (Bool; optional): Apply invalid style to the Input for feedback purposes. This will cause
any FormFeedback in the enclosing FormGroup with valid=False to display.
- `bs_size` (String; optional): Set the size of the Input. Options: 'sm' (small), 'md' (medium)
or 'lg' (large). Default is 'md'.
- `persistence` (Bool | String | Real; optional): Used to allow user interactions in this component to be persisted when
the component - or the page - is refreshed. If `persisted` is truthy and
hasn't changed from its previous value, a `value` that the user has
changed while using the app will keep that change, as long as
the new `value` also matches what was given originally.
Used in conjunction with `persistence_type`.
- `persisted_props` (Array of a value equal to: 'value's; optional): Properties whose user interactions will persist after refreshing the
component or the page. Since only `value` is allowed this prop can
normally be ignored.
- `persistence_type` (a value equal to: 'local', 'session', 'memory'; optional): Where persisted user changes will be stored:
memory: only kept in memory, reset on page refresh.
local: window.localStorage, data is kept after the browser quit.
session: window.sessionStorage, data is cleared once the browser quit.
