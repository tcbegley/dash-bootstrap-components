A Badge component.
Badges can be used to add counts or labels to other components.
Keyword arguments:
- `children` (a list of or a singular dash component, string or number; optional): The children of this component.
- `id` (String; optional): The ID of this component, used to identify dash components
in callbacks. The ID needs to be unique across all of the
components in an app.
- `style` (Dict; optional): Defines CSS styles which will override styles previously set.
- `className` (String; optional): Often used with CSS to style elements with common properties.
- `key` (String; optional): A unique identifier for the component, used to improve
performance by React.js while rendering components
See https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html for more info
- `color` (String; optional): Badge color, options: primary, secondary, success, info, warning, danger,
link. Default: secondary.
- `pill` (Bool; optional): Make badge "pill" shaped (rounded ends, like a pill). Default: False.
- `href` (String; optional): Attach link to badge.
- `tag` (String; optional): HTML tag to use for the Badge. Default: span.
- `loading_state` (optional): Object that holds the loading state object coming from dash-renderer. loading_state has the following type: lists containing elements 'is_loading', 'prop_name', 'component_name'.
Those elements have the following types:
  - `is_loading` (Bool; optional): Determines if the component is loading or not
  - `prop_name` (String; optional): Holds which property is loading
  - `component_name` (String; optional): Holds the name of the component that is loading
- `external_link` (Bool; optional): If true, the browser will treat this as an external link,
forcing a page refresh at the new location. If false,
this just changes the location without triggering a page
refresh. Use this if you are observing dcc.Location, for
instance. Defaults to true for absolute URLs and false
otherwise.
- `n_clicks` (Real; optional): An integer that represents the number of times
that this element has been clicked on.
- `n_clicks_timestamp` (Real; optional): An integer that represents the time (in ms since 1970)
at which n_clicks changed. This can be used to tell
which button was changed most recently.
- `target` (String; optional): Target attribute to pass on to the link. Only applies to external links.
